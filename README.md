 # Overview
Based on the Pacman game, a character trying to launder money has to escape from the police at the same time. Each time he collects money, his score increases and with each big bill he collects, he throws the cops in and drives them away from him so that it becomes easier for him to collect money. 

 # Assets

Assets are inspired by Pacman game and some assets are taken directly from Pacman game. 

 # Scripts

In the scripts part, I had a lot of difficulty because I did not have a game experience before, I was inspired by the projects that had been done before by doing research on the internet and applied them according to myself. I saw a lot of people making such games with different ways, everyone had different techniques and methods that they used differently, and I completed this game by choosing the ones that suited me.
